dsgedata.m is a draw of 160 observations on the 5 observed variables from the model CGHK, at the true
parameter values. 

When estimating by ML using Dynare, you can use only one or two variables,
even if order=2. This is due to the "stochastic singularity" problem, for
linearized models. I'm not sure why it applies to the second order solution,
that is a Dynare particularity, I think.
