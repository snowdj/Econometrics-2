# This is an example of estimation of a portfolio model
# as in Hansen and Singleton, 1982. The data comes from
# Tauchen, JBES, 1986 (available by ftp).
# The notation follows my lecture notes. In particular
# gamma is the coefficient of RRA. Try out different sets
# of intruments and different lag lengths. You will see
# that beta is stable across  models, but that gamma is not.

# The main thing you have to to is define the moments for estimation,
# as in the function that follows immediately, and ensure that the
# efficient weight matrix is estimated appropriately. The rest
# is already programmed.


# the following function defines the moment conditions, given the parameter
# vector and the instruments. It returns the individual contributions
# to allow estimation of the covariance matrix of the moments.
